# How to access and execute RMD file

Installing and loading the necessary libraries and loading the associated data set are prerequisites for running the RMD R file. My recommendation is to make a folder to hold both the dataset and the RMD file when you download both, then inside that folder, make another folder called "DataSets" and put the excel file containing the data set inside of that. All of the work is done in a R Markdown file when you open the RMD file, and you must import the dataset in order to execute it. You can access the data set in the "DataSets" folder or any other name you like from the files tab. The route link for the imported data set must be copied after the data set has been imported since it must run with the installed libraries in order for the code to run. All codes should now run and function correctly after completing that. The codes can be knitted into PDF or HTML files, as desired.

# Basic descriptive statistic and intermediate visuals

R is used to do basic descriptive statistics and detailed visualization on a collection of global market data including profit and loss. Taking out many boxplots and histograms and placing them side by side using the par function to present various visuals to related data. employing filters to present data and visualizations like bar plots, pie charts, and dot plots.

## Skill used â€“ 

R, HTML, Tidyverse, dplyr, knitr, RColorBrewer libraries was used

## Output-

A clear study on the global market that includes illustrations and recommendations based on those illustrations. Additionally, intermediary R functions like mutate, filter, par, mai, tapply, etc. are used to filter data.
