Descriptive statistics are used to organize data with the help of graphs and numbers and this process is used to understand a specific set of observations. We can use Bar Graphs, histograms, Pie Charts, etc. to summarize our data here.
<BR>
Inferential Statistics is used when we take our sample data and use it to make an inference/assumption to draw a conclusion on the whole population. We can use probability here to determine how confident we are that the conclusion we made is correct.
<BR>
Data Presentation is a powerful way to present data to people by making it easily understandable as well as readable at the same time. It can effectively present the largest amount of complex data in a simple manner. Some data presentation tools are histogram, box plot, pie chart, etc.
<BR>
R is an open-source language used mainly for statistical computing in top/big companies. It can be used for a variety of purposes like measuring central tendency, dispersion, or using probability to explore assumption-based analysis.

The dataset was already provided to us by our instructor Dr. Dee Chiluiza and the objective of this report was already laid out. Also, the data was already cleaned so only interpretation of data and sharing the result were achieved during this report. 
<BR> 
During this report, I learned about how to access specific region data using the tapply() function from a list of multiple regions dataset. Not only that I learned how to play with that and made descriptive analysis on the resulted data. Other than that I learned about barplot, bargraphy, piechart, and dot chart.

<B>Descriptions of: integer, factor, double, numeric</B>
<BR>
Numeric is the most common data type that is used in R. A variable/list/series will be stored in the data if the values are either numbers or decimals.
<BR>
An integer is a special case of numeric data. These are numbers without decimals. So, these are used to store only those numeric values which donâ€™t contain decimals.
<BR>
Double is a floating-point vector in R and is used to store both the integer as well as decimal values. Double can also store special values like not a number, negative infinity, etc.
<BR>
The factor is a special case of character variables that also contains the text. However, factors are used where there is a limited number of unique character strings. For instance, in gender, you make a factor of male, female.

<B>Observations.</B>
<BR>
By analyzing the box plot we can see that most of the profits made were around the mean/median mark but it has a lot of outliers usually around the 2000 price range. But in the histogram, most of the profit was made by the same products/sale.
<BR>
We can use the par() function to display multiple graphs in a single plot. We can use this function to compare multiple graphs by placing them in a row or in a column.
<BR>
We can use mfrow for rows and mfcol for columns.

Conclusion
</CENTER>
</B>
<FONT SIZE = 5, COLOR = "CD9E69">
<P><BR>
In conclusion, I got a better understanding of how analysis is done in R language as a whole. Also, I learned about HTML codes and how to represent them on RMarkdown and learned about various new libraries which helped my report look aesthetically more pleasing.
<BR> 
Other than that I got to know about new functions like tapply(), text(), par() which helped me in analyzing the whole dataset and making a more presentable report. Also, I learned a lot about bar plots, boxplots, and piecharts and how various functions are used to make changes in them like ylim, col, main, etc..
<BR>
So, after analyzing the report my recommendation would be to target the Asia Pacific market more as it gave the largest amount of sales compared to other Regions. Other than that, in Africa, more technologies should be pushed into the market as they had the highest amount of sales, especially phones which had the highest amount of sales in the technology department. Also, Copiers had the highest average amount of profit in the technology department so we should keep an eye on that as well. 
<BR> 
Central Africa had a substantial amount of sales compared to the African regions followed by North Africa. The same goes for Central America in the LATAM Market. It doubled its sales compared to its peer South American Market and quadrupled compared to the Caribbean Market.
