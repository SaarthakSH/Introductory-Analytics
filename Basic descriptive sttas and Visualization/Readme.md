# How to access and execute RMD file

Installing and loading the necessary libraries and loading the associated data set are prerequisites for running the RMD R file. My recommendation is to make a folder to hold both the dataset and the RMD file when you download both, then inside that folder, make another folder called "DataSets" and put the excel file containing the data set inside of that. All of the work is done in a R Markdown file when you open the RMD file, and you must import the dataset in order to execute it. You can access the data set in the "DataSets" folder or any other name you like from the files tab. The route link for the imported data set must be copied after the data set has been imported since it must run with the installed libraries in order for the code to run. All codes should now run and function correctly after completing that. The codes can be knitted into PDF or HTML files, as desired.

# Basic descriptive statistics and visualizations

R is used to do basic descriptive statistics and data visualization on a data set for the fishing business. Basic statistics are performed using the summary function, and the cumulative frequency and percentage for each fish in the whole dataset are discovered using the mutate function. employing selected data to compare with one another using graphics like boxplots and scatterplots after filtering out data from the complete dataset.

## Skill used â€“ 

R, HTML, Tidyverse, dplyr, knitr, RColorBrewer, magrittr libraries was used

## Output-

A well-written study about the fishing industry that includes illustrations and recommendations based on those illustrations. As well as advanced R functions like mutate, filter, par, mai, etc. that are used to filter data.
